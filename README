This is my reimplementation of iaindooley's "pickdrop" utility.

Pick each file you want and then just drop them all into the same directory.
Saves heaps of typing when you're moving lots of files at once.

Installation:
Requires python.
copy each file to /usr/bin and set permissions to 755

Usage:
First pick the objects(files or directories) that you wish to copy/move,
these may be relative or absolute
    pick object1 [object2 object3...]
Next, copy all your objects into their destination
    drop
Alternativly you may rather move your objects
    dropmv
You may wish to specify a path to copy to
    drop /home/username/somedirectory
or
    drop somedirectory

If you need to reset pick, just clear remove ~/.pick
